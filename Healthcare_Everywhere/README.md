HealthCare_Everywhere
=====================

this is a client_side web design projects about providing information about some diseases based on symptoms, and other health information.
The website will organize educational information for patients on common conditions in the area and their symptoms,
preventions, and treatments and allow users to search for likely conditions they might have based on their symptoms.
The site will have a map to locate patients. The site will later be expanded as the eMedicine program grows and
it could potentially be catered to other healthcare systems as well.
